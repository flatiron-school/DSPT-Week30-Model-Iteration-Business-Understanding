# Week 30 Challenge: Model Iteration and Business Understanding (through the lens of product review classification)

## The Challenge:

Northwind Trading Company allows customers to leave reviews, but those reviews do not have customer-facing "star ratings".  Instead, customers are free to write text, and other customers can vote on whether the review was helpful.  They find that this is a good trade-off between helping customers make informed decisions about products, and avoiding having any products go unsold because of poor ratings.

Internally, Northwind is interested to know which of these reviews are positive, and which are negative.  **A previous employee of the company has already built a Random Forest Classifier model to perform this classification task.**

Northwind management has heard great things about using Artificial Intelligence for this kind of task, especially Neural Networks like TensorFlow.  

### You have been instructed to build a TensorFlow model and advise the company on whether they should switch from the Random Forest Classifier to the TensorFlow model.

In either case, you want a **classification model** that optimizes for **accuracy**.
